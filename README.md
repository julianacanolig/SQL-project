Simulation of a student/instructor portal to provide courses feedback 

The course evaluation website offers a minimalist interface with two options on the homepage: "Student" and "Instructor."
In the "Student" section, users can either start a new evaluation or update an existing one. For instructors, there's a straightforward "Review" page where they can view evaluations. This simplicity ensures a user-friendly experience with clear navigation and minimal clutter.
